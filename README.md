There is a bunch of documentation on how to work on `postcss.org` in the `docs/` folder, [`Getting Started`](docs/getting-started.md) is a good place to begin!

### Technical specifications

`postcss.org` uses [Statinamic](http://moox.io/statinamic/) as a static site generator. Statinamic is based on [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), a user interface library made by Facebook. Other top of that we use CSS Modules, Redux, Babel, webpack and (obviously) PostCSS.
