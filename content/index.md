PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.

PostCSS is used by industry leaders including Google, Twitter, Alibaba, and Shopify. The Autoprefixer PostCSS plugin is one of the most popular CSS processors.
